#Data incubator proposed project
This repository contains the sample code for image analysis used to study the changes in riparian vegetation following dam construction.
Choosing the Capanda Dam, Angola as an example, I will use Landsat 5 imagery for 2000 (before dam was built), 2005, 2010 and Landsat 8 for 2015, to identify NDVI thresholds associated with riparian vegetation. Analysis is made following the next few steps:
--> Using an SRTM 30m DEM image for the area, define watershed and stream characteristics of the region.
--> using the delineated watershed, identify regions in a 500m, 1000m and 1500m using NDVI  thresholds.
--> determine riparian stacks location, areal coverage, relation to channel slope, and change over time.
